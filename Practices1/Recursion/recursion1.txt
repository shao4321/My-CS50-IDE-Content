Points to take note:

1) Does the algorithm terminate?
    - By having a base case
    - Calling recursion on smaller and smaller prices of information/inputs.

2) Is the algorithm correct?

3) Is it efficient? (What's the runtime?)

We can distill the idea of recursion into two simple rules:

- Each recursive call should be on a smaller instance of the same problem, that is, a smaller subproblem.
- The recursive calls must eventually reach a base case, which is solved without further recursion.
